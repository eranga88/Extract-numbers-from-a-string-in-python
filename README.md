program that takes a string (consists of words separated by space/tab, not necessarily as to be meaningful) as input and performs following operations (example input – “3 f4w 34 451 5hgt fdf34d s3fs 2 erff fs ytr”): 
a) Eliminates all non-numeric symbols (keep only the numbers) and displays the string (for the above sample input the string will be “3 4 34 451 5 34 3, 2”) 
b) From the resultant string in part a, creates two lists of numbers – ‘listA’ and ‘listB’ and displays them. where ‘listA’ is the list of all odd numbers and ‘listB’ is the list of rest of the numbers. For the above sample input, the content of the lists would be: listA: [3 451 5 3] listB: [4 34 34 2]
